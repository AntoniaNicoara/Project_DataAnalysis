# Project Title

The distribution of education levels at the county level in Romania

## Overview
I have developed this analysis project for college, applying what I learned in the Software Development and Data Analysis course. It focuses on examining and understanding the distribution of education levels at the county level in Romania. The dataset used includes essential information regarding preschool, primary and lower secondary education (including special education), upper secondary education, vocational education, post-secondary non-tertiary education, tertiary education leading to a bachelor's degree, as well as master's and doctoral education. The data for this analysis was sourced from the official website of the National Institute of Statistics.

## Purpose
My purpose was to identify trends, disparities, and potential patterns in the provision and access to various levels of education across different regions of the country. For this project, I applied principal component analysis and factor analysis techniques.

## Credits
This project was developed by Nicoara Antonia-Elena.
